# a-delightful-portfolio
A static React portfolio website developed for the digital artist formally known as @adelightfulgood (currently goes by [@pocketrituals](https://twitter.com/PocketRituals)) \
Access the current version of the website [here](https://ganglyimp.github.io/a-delightful-portfolio/). This project has gone on a bit of a hiatus ever since the artist went through a rebranding crisis. I might come back to it later to fix some performance issues and do some other general cleanup. 

## Running the project locally

1. Clone the git repository.
2. In the project directory, run `npm install` to install any required dependencies.
3. Afterwards, run `npm start` to run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Run `npm run build` to build the app for production to the `build` folder.
